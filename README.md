# Test task for Inforce

## Used technologies
  * React
  * Redux toolkit
  * React Router
  * Bulma

[DEMO]('https://FANTAZER-NURE.github.io/inforce-task')


  *There are no products API on JSON server,*
  *so I decided to use API that I used before,*
  *which has almost similar structure and provides products*


  *I will keep comments that user adds*
  *in the Redux, but will load all other comments*
  *from the API in order to optimize(load comments*
  *only if needed), I'm not using POST request,*
  *because it will not be saved on JSON server*
